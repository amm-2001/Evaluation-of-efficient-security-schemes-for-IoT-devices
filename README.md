# Evaluation-of-efficient-security-schemes-for-IoT-devices
My Graduation Project for Bachelor degree in Computer Science

The aim of the project was to measure the time of execution, security and fidelity of a microcontroller with low processing power in running 3 cryptography algorithms and sends the encrypted data throgh WiFi. We have chosen AES, Camellia and RC4 for this project, the microcontroller first will connect to a WiFi signal in which the server is also connected to then it will run one of the encryption algorithms and encrypt some data(when the encryption proecess executed a timer starts until it finishes the the encryption) before sending the encrypted results to the server through the network, the server will decrypt the data and show it to the user.
